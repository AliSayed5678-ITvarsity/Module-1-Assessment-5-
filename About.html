        <br/>
        <p>Creating this project was fun and interesting</p>
        <p>It would be due to my inovations to the project where I learnt new stuff for the project(for example learning and applying logos to the menu-bar even though it might no be perfect)</p>
        <p>My innovations to the project I chose to showcase in the villain section and chose to leave the original project (the hero section) to show you ,the viewer, the difference from what was ecxpected and my vision/take on this project and how i would execute the project.</p>
        <p>As for the info, though I may not have been a Marvel fan nor really watched Marvel for that case, i had to look intensively easpecially for the power stats for each character but this project did help me gain some insight into the franchise of which I'm grateful for.</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Time taken for the creation of the project : 4 - 5 hours </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Research and brainstorming of ideas : 3 - 4 hours </p>
        <br>
        <p>Application and fixing of errors with account of applying new info/codes : 1 - 2 hours</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Total time spent on the project : 8 - 11  hours</p>
        
        <p>Thank you! IT varsity for teaching this lesson in coding</p>
