    <p id="decription"><b>Some insight:</b> Tony Stark, the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark, inherited Stark Industries after his parentsâ€™ untimely death. A genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions, Tony designed cutting-edge weapons for the company. His life took a dark turn when he was captured during a weapons contract consultation in enemy territory. An improvised explosive device left a piece of shrapnel inches from his heart. Fellow captive Yinsen helped Tony build the first Iron Man suit, which saved his life and allowed him to escape. Since then, Tony has created numerous upgraded versions of the Iron Man armor, dedicating his life to protecting the world from threats</p>
